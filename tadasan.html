        <div><h3>What Does Tadasana Mean?</h3><hr>
            Tadasana is the Sanskrit name for a fundamental yoga asana, otherwise known as Mountain Pose. It is considered to be the blueprint that forms the basis of all other standing postures. Tadasana is the starting and finishing position of all Sun Salutation sequences, in addition to its use as a resting pose between other more strenuous postures. The term is derived from two Sanskrit roots; tada, meaning "mountain" and asana meaning "seat" or "posture."</div>
